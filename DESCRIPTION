Description: Online data collection tools like Google Forms often export
    multiple-response questions with data concatenated in cells. The
    concat.split family of functions conveniently splits such data into
    separate cells. The package also includes functions to conveniently stack
    groups of columns and to reshape wide data, even when the data are
    "unbalanced"---something which reshape (from base R) does not handle, and
    which melt and dcast from reshape2 do not easily handle.
