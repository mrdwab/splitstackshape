## 1.1.0

18 August 2013

### Enhancement

* `Stacked` and `merge.stack` now made MUCH faster using almost
  a pure `data.table` solution.

## 1.0.2

17 August 2013

### Bugfixes

* When `Stacked` results in a list of length 1, it is "unlisted"
  before being returned.
* `Reshape` (and as a result, `concat.split.multiple(..., 
  direction = "long")`) has been enhanced by the addition of a
  feature to automatically add an ID variable if the present 
  "IDs" are not unique.

## Feature Changes

New functions added:

* getanID
* :::Names

## 1.0.1

16 August 2013

### Bugfixes

* `read.concat` updated to use `count.fields` to determine the 
  correct number of columns that the resulting `data.frame` 
  should have.

### Feature change

* `Reshape` now has an option to remove the `rownames` from the
  output, set to `TRUE` by default.

## 1.0

12 August 2013

Initial commit of splitstacshape with the following main functions:

* concat.split (plus: concat.split.compact, concat.split.expanded, 
  concat.split.list, and concat.split.multiple) -- To split 
  concatenated data into more manageable data formats.
* Reshape -- To help base R's reshape function handle unbalanced 
  data and simplify the reshape syntax (wide to long only).
* Stacked -- To selectively stack columns of a data.frame.

### Full list of functions

*Non-exported functions are indicated with ::: before their names*

* concat.split.compact
* concat.split.expanded
* concat.split.list
* concat.split.multiple
* concat.split
* merged.stack
* Reshape
* Stacked
* :::binaryMat
* :::FacsToChars
* :::NoSep
